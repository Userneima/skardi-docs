# GGUF (llama.cpp)

This guide shows how to use the `gguf()` scalar UDF to run local GGUF-format
embedding inference directly inside SQL via llama.cpp, and combine it with
`lance_knn()` for semantic search — no external embedding API, no Python in the
hot path.

## How It Works

```sql
-- Embed the query on the fly, find the 10 nearest docs
SELECT id, title, content, _distance
FROM lance_knn(
  'doc_embeddings_gguf',
  'embedding',
  gguf('models/generated/embeddinggemma-300m', {query}),
  10
)
ORDER BY _distance
LIMIT 10
```

`gguf()` signature:

```sql
gguf(model_dir, text_col [, normalize]) -> List<Float32>
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `model_dir` | Path to a directory containing a single `.gguf` weights file. |
| `text_col` | Text column or scalar to embed. |
| `normalize` | Optional boolean (default `true`). `true` → L2 unit-norm vectors for cosine similarity. `false` → raw vectors for dot-product search. |

The model is loaded and cached on first call — subsequent queries pay no loading cost.

### Why GGUF?

GGUF models use the llama.cpp inference backend, which natively handles tensor
naming, tokenization, and architecture wiring for all supported model families.
No manual `config.json` or architecture detection needed — everything is embedded
in the `.gguf` file.

GGUF also supports multiple quantisation levels (Q4, Q5, Q8, F16, F32), making
it possible to run embedding models with a fraction of the memory footprint.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.12** and dependencies for the setup script:
   ```bash
   pip install llama-cpp-python lancedb huggingface_hub pyarrow
   ```

2. **Accept Google's Gemma licence** (required for the tokenizer):
   - Visit https://huggingface.co/google/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-q8_0-unquantized
   - Accept the licence agreement
   - Authenticate: `huggingface-cli login`

3. **Build the server** with the `gguf` feature:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p skardi-server --features gguf
   ```

## Setup

Run once from the **project root** to download the model and create the Lance dataset:

```bash
python docs/embeddings/gguf/setup_gguf.py
```

This will:
- Download `embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0.gguf` (~329 MB) into `models/generated/embeddinggemma-300m/`
- Download `tokenizer.json` from the gated Gemma repo
- Embed the 15 knowledge-base documents in `docs/embeddings/data/docs.csv`
- Write a Lance dataset to `docs/embeddings/gguf/data/generated/doc_embeddings_gguf.lance`

Expected output:
```
[1/4] Downloading embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0.gguf from ggml-org/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-q8_0-GGUF (~329 MB) ...

      Embedding dimension: 256
      Lance dataset written to docs/embeddings/gguf/data/generated/doc_embeddings_gguf.lance
```

## Starting the Server

```bash
cargo run -p skardi-server --features gguf -- \
  --ctx docs/embeddings/gguf/ctx.yaml \
  --pipeline docs/embeddings/gguf/pipelines/ \
  --port 8080
```

## Running Queries

The `semantic-search-gguf` pipeline loaded above is now reachable either
directly over HTTP or through the `skardi` CLI (a thin HTTP client — see
[docs/cli.md](/docs/cli)). Both forms send the same request.

### Semantic Search

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/semantic-search-gguf/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "how does similarity search work in vector databases?",
    "k": 10
  }' | jq .
```

Equivalent call via the CLI:

```bash
skardi run semantic-search-gguf \
  -p query="how does similarity search work in vector databases?" \
  -p k=10
```

## Switching Models

Any GGUF embedding model works. Download a different model and update the path
in the pipeline SQL:

```sql
-- Use a different GGUF model in the pipeline
gguf('models/generated/nomic-embed-text-v1.5', {query})
```

Re-run `setup_gguf.py` with updated `MODEL_DIR` / `GGUF_REPO` / `GGUF_FILE`
to rebuild the Lance dataset with the new model's embeddings.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load GGUF model"
Ensure the path is relative to the directory where you started `skardi-server`
and that the model directory contains a single `.gguf` file.

### "table 'doc_embeddings_gguf' not found"
Run `setup_gguf.py` first to create the Lance dataset.

### "Could not download tokenizer.json"
The tokenizer is hosted in a gated repo. Accept the Gemma licence at
https://huggingface.co/google/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-q8_0-unquantized
and run `huggingface-cli login`.

### Slow first query
The first call loads and caches the model (~329 MB). Subsequent queries are fast.
Use `RUST_LOG=info` to see load timing in the server logs.
