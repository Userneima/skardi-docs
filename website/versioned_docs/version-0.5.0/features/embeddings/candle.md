# Candle (local SafeTensors)

This guide shows how to use the `candle()` scalar UDF to run local BERT-style
embedding inference directly inside SQL, and combine it with `lance_knn()` for
semantic search — no external embedding API, no Python in the hot path.

## How It Works

```sql
-- Embed the query on the fly, find the 5 nearest docs
SELECT id, title, content, _distance
FROM lance_knn(
  'doc_embeddings',
  'embedding',
  candle('models/generated/bge-small-en-v1.5', {query}),
  10
)
ORDER BY _distance
LIMIT 10
```

`candle()` signature:

```sql
candle(model_dir, text_col [, normalize]) -> List<Float32>
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `model_dir` | Path to a directory containing a `.safetensors` weights file, `config.json`, and `tokenizer.json`. |
| `text_col` | Text column or scalar to embed. |
| `normalize` | Optional boolean (default `true`). `true` → L2 unit-norm vectors for cosine similarity. `false` → raw mean-pooled vectors for dot-product search. |

The model is loaded and cached on first call — subsequent queries pay no loading cost.

### Supported Architectures

The architecture is detected automatically from `config.json`:

| `architectures` value | Model family |
|---|---|
| `BertModel`, `RobertaModel`, `XLMRobertaModel` | bge-\*, all-MiniLM-\*, e5-\*, … |
| `DistilBertModel` | distilbert-\* |
| `JinaBertModel` | jina-embeddings-\* |

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.12** and dependencies for the setup script:
   ```bash
   pip install fastembed lance lancedb huggingface_hub pyarrow
   ```
   > Python 3.12 is required — `onnxruntime` (used by `fastembed`) has no
   > pre-built wheels for Python 3.13+.

2. **Build the server** with the `candle` feature:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p skardi-server --features candle
   ```

## Setup

Run once from the **project root** to download the model and create the Lance dataset:

```bash
python docs/embeddings/candle/setup.py
```

This will:
- Download `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` SafeTensors weights into `models/generated/bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- Embed the 15 knowledge-base documents in `docs/embeddings/data/docs.csv`
- Write a Lance dataset to `docs/embeddings/candle/data/generated/doc_embeddings.lance`

Expected output:
```
[1/3] Downloading BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 into models/generated/bge-small-en-v1.5 ...
      model.safetensors: 133.4 MB
      config.json: 0.0 MB
      tokenizer.json: 0.7 MB
[2/3] Loaded 15 documents from docs/embeddings/data/docs.csv
[3/3] Embedding 15 documents with BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 ...
      Embedding dimension: 384
      Lance dataset written to docs/embeddings/candle/data/generated/doc_embeddings.lance
```

## Starting the Server

```bash
cargo run -p skardi-server --features candle -- \
  --ctx docs/embeddings/candle/ctx.yaml \
  --pipeline docs/embeddings/candle/pipelines/ \
  --port 8080
```

## Running Queries

The `semantic-search` pipeline loaded above is now reachable either directly
over HTTP or through the `skardi` CLI (a thin HTTP client — see
[docs/cli.md](/docs/cli)). Both forms send the same request.

### Semantic Search

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/semantic-search/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "how does similarity search work in vector databases?",
    "k": 10
  }' | jq .
```

Equivalent call via the CLI:

```bash
skardi run semantic-search \
  -p query="how does similarity search work in vector databases?" \
  -p k=10
```

**Response** (truncated — returns up to `k` results):

## Switching Models

Any HuggingFace embedding model in SafeTensors format works. Download a
different model and update the path in the pipeline SQL:

```bash
# Download a larger, higher-quality model
huggingface-cli download BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 \
  --include "model.safetensors" "config.json" "tokenizer.json" \
  --local-dir models/generated/bge-base-en-v1.5
```

```sql
-- Use the larger model in the pipeline
candle('models/generated/bge-base-en-v1.5', {query})
```

Re-run `setup.py` with `MODEL_ID = "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"` and
`MODEL_DIR = Path("models/generated/bge-base-en-v1.5")` to rebuild the Lance dataset
with the new model's embeddings.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load candle model"
Ensure the path is relative to the directory where you started `skardi-server`
and that the model directory contains all three files: `model.safetensors`, `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`.

### "table 'doc_embeddings' not found"
Run `setup.py` first to create the Lance dataset.

### "Unknown architecture '...'; falling back to BertModel"
The model's `config.json` lists an architecture Skardi hasn't seen before.
It falls back to BERT, which covers most encoder models. If inference fails,
open an issue with the model name.

### Slow first query
The first call loads and caches the model (~133 MB for bge-small). Subsequent
queries are fast. Use `RUST_LOG=info` to see load timing in the server logs.
