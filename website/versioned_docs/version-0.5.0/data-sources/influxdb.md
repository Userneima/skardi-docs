# InfluxDB 3

This guide covers querying **InfluxDB 3** (Core / Enterprise) from Skardi.

InfluxDB 3 is itself built on Apache Arrow + DataFusion and exposes an Arrow
**Flight SQL** endpoint. Skardi connects to that endpoint and registers each
measurement (or an arbitrary SQL query) as a table, so you can `SELECT`,
aggregate, and **federate InfluxDB time-series data with any other Skardi
source** (CSV, Postgres, Iceberg, …) in a single query.

> **Access is read-only.** Flight SQL serves `SELECT`s only. Writes to InfluxDB
> go through the line-protocol ingest API and are out of scope for the query
> engine — `access_mode: read_write` is rejected for InfluxDB sources.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start InfluxDB 3 Core in Docker (auth disabled for the demo)
docker run -d --name influxdb3-skardi \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  -v influxdb3-skardi-data:/var/lib/influxdb3 \
  influxdb:3-core influxdb3 serve \
    --node-id node0 \
    --object-store file \
    --data-dir /var/lib/influxdb3 \
    --without-auth

# 2. Create the database
curl -s -XPOST "http://localhost:8181/api/v3/configure/database" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"db": "metrics"}'

# 3. Write sample data (line protocol: cpu + mem measurements)
curl -s "http://localhost:8181/api/v3/write_lp?db=metrics&precision=second" \
  --data-binary @- << 'EOF'
cpu,host=host1,region=us-west usage_user=12.5,usage_system=3.2 1700000000
cpu,host=host1,region=us-west usage_user=64.1,usage_system=9.8 1700000060
cpu,host=host2,region=us-west usage_user=41.0,usage_system=6.0 1700000000
cpu,host=host2,region=us-west usage_user=88.7,usage_system=12.3 1700000060
cpu,host=host3,region=us-east usage_user=22.4,usage_system=4.1 1700000000
mem,host=host1,region=us-west used_percent=48.2 1700000000
mem,host=host2,region=us-west used_percent=73.9 1700000000
mem,host=host3,region=us-east used_percent=31.5 1700000000
EOF

# 4. Start the Skardi server against the demo context + pipelines
cargo run --bin skardi-server -- \
  --ctx docs/influxdb/ctx_influxdb_demo.yaml \
  --pipeline docs/influxdb/pipelines/ \
  --port 8080
```

## Data Model

An InfluxDB measurement maps to a SQL table:

| InfluxDB concept | SQL projection |
|------------------|----------------|
| measurement (`cpu`) | table (`cpu`) |
| tag (`host`, `region`) | `Utf8` column |
| field (`usage_user`) | `Float64` / typed column |
| `time` | `Timestamp(ns)` column |

Each Skardi data source binds to **one** measurement (via the `measurement`
option) or **one** SQL query (via the `query` option). To expose several
measurements, declare one data source per measurement — see
`ctx_influxdb_demo.yaml`, which registers both `cpu`
and `mem`.

The table's Arrow schema is inferred at server startup from InfluxDB's
`GetFlightInfo` response, so the InfluxDB endpoint must be reachable when Skardi
loads its context (the same eager-connect behaviour as the Postgres/MySQL/Mongo
providers).

## Query Pushdown

The backing query is fixed when the source is registered. Predicates,
projections, and `LIMIT`s that appear in a **pipeline's** SQL (e.g.
`WHERE host = {host}`) are *not* pushed to InfluxDB — Skardi fetches the whole
measurement over Flight and applies them locally. This is fine for small or
bounded measurements, but for large time-series it means a full-measurement
scan per query.

To push work into InfluxDB's own query engine, bake the filter / projection /
aggregation into the source's **`query` option** (see
[Custom Query / Pre-aggregation](#custom-query--pre-aggregation-pushing-filters-into-influxdb)
below, with a side-by-side cost comparison); that SQL is sent verbatim and runs
server-side. Dynamic, per-request pushdown is tracked as a follow-up.

## Available Pipelines

Every pipeline is **parameterised** — each `execute` call supplies its parameters
in the JSON request body (the `{name}` placeholders in the pipeline SQL).

| Pipeline | Parameters | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `list_all_cpu` | `limit` | Most recent `limit` CPU samples, newest first |
| `cpu_by_host` | `host` | CPU samples for one `host` (tag filter) |
| `high_cpu` | `threshold` | Samples above a user-CPU `threshold` |
| `avg_usage_by_host` | `region` | Average user CPU per host within a `region` (aggregation) |
| `federated_cpu_by_datacenter` | `owner` | Join InfluxDB `cpu` with a CSV host map, rollup per datacenter for one `owner` |

> The response bodies below are captured from a live run against InfluxDB 3
> Core with the sample data above, using the parameter values shown in each
> request. `execution_time_ms` and `timestamp` vary per run.

## 5. Federated Query: InfluxDB ⨝ CSV

Join the InfluxDB `cpu` measurement with a CSV host → datacenter map and
aggregate per datacenter for a given `owner` — a single SQL query spanning two
backends.

```
InfluxDB (cpu)          CSV (host_metadata.csv)
      │                          │
      └────────────┬─────────────┘
                   │
              DataFusion
            JOIN + Aggregate
                   │
                   ▼
        per-datacenter rollup
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/federated_cpu_by_datacenter/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner": "platform"}' | jq .
```

**Response:** (`us-east-2a` is owned by `analytics` and is excluded)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {"datacenter": "us-west-1b", "owner": "platform", "avg_user": 64.85, "max_user": 88.7, "samples": 2},
    {"datacenter": "us-west-1a", "owner": "platform", "avg_user": 38.3, "max_user": 64.1, "samples": 2}
  ],
  "rows": 2,
  "execution_time_ms": 167
}
```

---

## Cleanup

```bash
docker stop influxdb3-skardi && docker rm influxdb3-skardi
docker volume rm influxdb3-skardi-data
pkill -f skardi-server
```

---

## Connection Options

InfluxDB sources use `connection_string` for the Flight gRPC endpoint URL
(e.g. `http://localhost:8181`, or `https://…` for TLS) and the following
`options` keys:

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `measurement` (alias `table`) | one of these | Measurement name; expands to `SELECT * FROM "\<measurement\>"`. |
| `query` | or this | Full SQL backing the table (overrides `measurement`). |
| `database` | yes | InfluxDB 3 database / bucket; sent as the `database` gRPC header so the server picks the right database. Required — registration fails if missing or blank (unless supplied via `flight.sql.header.database`). |
| `token_env` | for auth (preferred) | **Name of an environment variable** holding the API token. Resolved at registration; sent as `authorization: Bearer <token>`. Keeps the secret out of the YAML. Registration fails if the variable is unset or empty. |
| `token` | for auth (discouraged) | Inline API token. Works, but commits the secret to config and logs a warning — prefer `token_env`. Ignored when `token_env` is set; a blank value is rejected. |
| `flight.sql.*` | optional | Any raw Flight SQL driver option, forwarded verbatim (takes precedence). E.g. `flight.sql.username`, `flight.sql.password`, `flight.sql.header.<name>`. |

### With Authentication (production)

Real InfluxDB deployments require a token. Drop `--without-auth` and mint an
admin token:

```bash
docker exec influxdb3-skardi influxdb3 create token --admin
```

**Pass the token via an environment variable, not the YAML.** Point `token_env`
at a variable name and export the secret in the process environment:

```yaml
spec:
  data_sources:
    - name: "cpu"
      type: "influxdb"
      connection_string: "http://localhost:8181"
      options:
        database: "metrics"
        measurement: "cpu"
        token_env: "INFLUXDB_TOKEN"   # ← variable NAME, not the token itself
```

```bash
export INFLUXDB_TOKEN="apiv3_your_token_here"
skardi serve --context docs/influxdb/ctx_influxdb_demo.yaml
```

This keeps the token out of version control and lets the same config run across
environments by swapping the variable. An inline `token:` option still works for
throwaway local testing, but Skardi logs a warning and you should not commit it.

### Custom Query / Pre-aggregation (pushing filters into InfluxDB)

This is the lever that controls **how much data crosses the network**. Recall
from [Query Pushdown](#query-pushdown): the SQL you put in a *pipeline* runs in
Skardi, *after* the rows have already been pulled over Flight. The SQL you put in
a source's **`query` option** runs *inside InfluxDB*, before anything is sent.

So the rule of thumb is: **put every filter, projection, time range, and
aggregation you can into the `query` option.** Whatever you leave for the
pipeline to do, Skardi pays for by transferring the full measurement first.

#### Side-by-side: same result, very different cost

Goal: hourly average CPU for one host over the last day.

<table>
<tr><th>❌ Whole measurement + pipeline filter</th><th>✅ Pushed into the <code>query</code> option</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>

```yaml
# ctx: binds the ENTIRE measurement
- name: "cpu"
  type: "influxdb"
  connection_string: "http://localhost:8181"
  options:
    database: "metrics"
    measurement: "cpu"      # → SELECT * FROM "cpu"
```

```sql
-- pipeline: filtering/aggregating happens
-- in Skardi, locally
SELECT host,
       date_bin(INTERVAL '1 hour', time) AS hour,
       avg(usage_user) AS avg_user
FROM cpu
WHERE host = 'web-01'
  AND time > now() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY host, hour
```

**Transfers every row of `cpu`** (all hosts, all time)
over Flight, then throws almost all of it away.

</td><td>

```yaml
# ctx: binds a pre-aggregated, pre-filtered query
- name: "cpu_web01_hourly"
  type: "influxdb"
  connection_string: "http://localhost:8181"
  options:
    database: "metrics"
    query: >
      SELECT host,
             date_bin(INTERVAL '1 hour', time) AS hour,
             avg(usage_user) AS avg_user
      FROM cpu
      WHERE host = 'web-01'
        AND time > now() - INTERVAL '1 day'
      GROUP BY host, hour
```

```sql
-- pipeline: just read the table; the heavy
-- lifting already ran server-side
SELECT * FROM cpu_web01_hourly
```

**Transfers only the hourly rows for `web-01`** —
InfluxDB does the filter + rollup before sending.

</td></tr>
</table>

#### Practical notes

- **Time bounds matter most.** A `WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL '…'` clause in
  the `query` is the single biggest win on a growing measurement — without it,
  every scan walks the full history.
- **Parameterised, per-request filters** (e.g. a `{host}` the caller supplies)
  can't live in the `query` option, since the query is fixed at registration. If
  you need a value-per-call *and* server-side pushdown, register one source per
  value, or scope the `query` to the smallest superset (e.g. one datacenter, last
  7 days) so the pipeline filters a small set locally.
- **The SQL is InfluxDB's dialect** (DataFusion SQL), sent verbatim — so
  `date_bin`, `now()`, and `INTERVAL` run server-side exactly as written.
- Anything you can't push down still works; it just costs a full-measurement
  scan, which is fine for small or already-bounded measurements.
